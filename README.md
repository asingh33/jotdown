A pdf viewer, annotator project

I had been working on this PDF viewer and annotation app, for one project requirement.

This app is developed in Swift and PDF functionalities require PDFKit library.

I have implemented following features:
- Open a PDF file locally stored or on the cloud. 
  * Password protected PDF handling, included.   
- Add various annotations on the opened PDF file:
  * Select, highlight, strikethrough, underline the text.
  * Colored annotations support.
- An animated side toolbar with option to choose:
  * Pen thickness style i.e. like a pen or thick crayon.
  * Choose different color pallete
  * Temporary Undo functionality on clicking the 'purple' color. It was a placeholder functionality, while I was developing the app.
